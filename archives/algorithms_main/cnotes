char * vs char [] 

char * a = "asdf"
    pointer to a string
    - read only
    - not stored in stack. remains after function calls

char a[]= "abcd"
    - read/write
    - stored in stack. deleted after funciton pops
    - unsafe to return a at function exit

assignment is the only operation allowed for structs

deep vs shallow copy:
struct x{
    char * b;
}
x = y;


type qualifiers:
const, volatile

storage class specifiers:
auto
register
static
extern
typedef:
    1) multiple storage def not allowed ex) typedef static -> compilation error


static vars:
C: static vars only init using constants. otherwise compiliation error. C++ allows

static vars cannot be used in function params.
